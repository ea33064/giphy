(Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered)
The Giphy Project offers a straightforward and user-friendly experience. Here's how to use it and the functionalities it offers:

Search Bar: The main functionality of the project is the search bar located prominently at the top of the page. Users can enter keywords or phrases related to the GIFs they want to find.

Search Button: After entering the desired search query, users can click the "Search" button or press "Enter" to initiate the search.

Search Results: Upon submitting the search query, the project fetches relevant GIFs from the Giphy API and displays them in the results section below the search bar.

GIF Display: The GIFs are presented in a visually appealing grid layout, allowing users to easily browse through multiple options.

Responsive Design: The project is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Endless Scroll: As users scroll through the search results, more GIFs are dynamically loaded, providing an endless stream of content without the need for pagination.

Click to Expand: Users can click on individual GIFs to view them in a larger size or to access additional details such as the GIF's title or source.

Error Handling: The project includes error handling to gracefully manage situations where the API request fails or returns no results, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Ideas for future improvement
Advanced Search Filters: Implement advanced search filters to allow users to refine their search results based on parameters such as GIF size, duration, color, or popularity. This would provide users with more control over the content they're looking for and enhance their overall search experience.

User Accounts and Favorites: Introduce user accounts where users can create profiles, save their favorite GIFs, and create custom collections or playlists. This feature would enhance user engagement and encourage users to return to the site regularly to access their saved content.

Integration with Social Media Platforms: Enable seamless integration with popular social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, allowing users to easily share GIFs they find on the Giphy Project directly to their social media accounts. This would increase the project's visibility and reach a broader audience.
